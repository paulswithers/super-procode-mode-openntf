## History of fetching data<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

- [DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML) was introduced in **1997**
  with Internet Explorer 4.0. Since the then dominant Browser didn't support it,
  it initially took off slowly.
- Microsoft used it in Outlook Web access in **2000**,
- while Google used `XMLHttpRequest` in GMail in **2004**
- The term [AJAX](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)>) is attributed
  to [JJ Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James_Garrett) in **2005**.
- Now it had a name, adoption exploded
- W3C adopted it as standard in 2006
