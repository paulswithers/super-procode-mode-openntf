- `&` nesting selector applies to parent rule
- `:has()` matches parent element that has specific sibling or descendant
- `:not()` can be used to reverse rule
- `:valid` / `:invalid` for styling based on elements with valid value
- `:user-valid` / `user-invalid` to apply only after user interaction
